The Arduino ecosystem including it's boards, tools, SDKs and libraries make it super easy for hobbyist computer engineers to build electronic projects that incorporate pretty powerful microcontrollers and an environment to program those microcontrollers.

The Arduino IDE from arduino.cc provides a simple IDE that lets these hobbyists get started. However, it is really simple. As projects get bigger and more complex, Arduino developers need something more powerful. They need an IDE that supports pure C++ development with content assist and source navigation the professional developers take for granted.

The Arduino C++ IDE is a set of plug-ins that provide a professional, yet easy to use development environment for Arduino programming that leverages the power of the industry leading Eclipse CDT. Building on Eclipse, the Arduino programmer can learn important skills and take advantage of the larger Eclipse ecosystem to build true Internet of Things projects that span from their microcontrollers to the cloud.

To help you get started we have an introductory video on YouTube that will walk through how to install and build and launch Arduino C++ applications on your boards.

As the Arduino C++ IDE is a part of the Eclipse CDT project, please visit the CDT forum for any questions you may have. Also file any bugs in the CDT bugzilla area under the component cdt-arduino. As this is a preview, please be patient but please do report any issues you see or ask for features so we can make it even better.

## Introduction Video
[Doug Schaefer](https://github.com/dschaefer) put toguether a very nice introductory video showing some of the features available.
